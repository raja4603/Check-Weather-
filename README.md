Weather App

Overview
The Weather App is a simple web application that provides real-time weather information based on user input. Users can search for a city or location and receive current weather conditions, temperature, and a brief forecast.

Description
The Weather App uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data. It displays the following information:

Current temperature
Weather description (e.g., “Cloudy,” “Sunny,” etc.)
Humidity
Wind speed

Technologies Used
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
OpenWeatherMap API

Learnings
During this project, I learned how to make API requests, handle asynchronous data, and create a responsive UI.
